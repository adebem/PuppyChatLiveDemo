# PuppyChat
Welcome to PuppyChat! This is a project meant to showcase my skills in the python programming language. PuppyChat intelligently answers trivia questions about the American Kennel Club's top 60 most popular dog breeds from 2019. You can ask about specific dogs, compare two dogs, or even compare one dog to the rest!

**NOTE:** All of the dog breed information is sourced from the American Kennel Club's Website. None of the information supplied is mine.

## Setup
